# AWG Split Tunnel — Example Configuration
# Uses WinTUN gateway adapter + WFP per-process interface blocking.
# No adapter_index needed — traffic is routed via TUN adapter automatically.

# Global IP/app filters (optional).
# Applied to ALL tunnels before per-tunnel filters.
global:
  # Local/private networks (RFC 1918, link-local, multicast, loopback)
  # are automatically excluded from VPN. Set disable_local: true to
  # override this and route ALL traffic (including local) through VPN.
  # disable_local: true

  # Additional IPs that always bypass VPN (go direct). Checked before AllowedIPs.
  # Bare IPs (without /mask) are treated as /32.
  disallowed_ips:
    - "212.193.55.91/32"   # Specific server

  # Apps that always go direct (bypass VPN entirely).
  # Same pattern syntax as rules: exe name, substring, path glob, dir\*
  disallowed_apps:
    - "steam.exe"
    - 'C:\Games\*'

  # If set, only these IPs go through VPN. Default: all traffic.
  # Omit to route all matched traffic through VPN.
  # allowed_ips:
  #   - "0.0.0.0/0"

# DNS routing configuration (optional).
# Controls how DNS queries are routed per-process.
dns:
  # Tunnel for system DNS queries (svchost.exe, unmatched processes).
  # Omit or leave empty to route through direct (system DNS via real NIC).
  tunnel_id: awg-germany

  # DNS servers for fallback queries.
  # If empty, uses the tunnel's built-in DNS servers from WG config.
  servers:
    - "1.1.1.1"
    - "8.8.8.8"

# Logging configuration (optional).
# Controls log verbosity globally and per-component.
# Levels: debug, info, warn, error, off (default: info).
# Fatalf always prints regardless of level.
logging:
  level: info
  # Per-component overrides (lowercase component name):
  #   core, gateway, route, wfp, dns, proxy, rule, awg, direct
  # components:
  #   dns: off       # Silence DNS per-query logs
  #   gateway: debug # Verbose gateway/packet logs
